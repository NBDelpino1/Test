            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                It was time for our Bootcamp’s final GROUP project and my team and I had no clue what we were going to build. We thought - another restaurant finding app? - blah. How about a complicated gaming app? - nope, we only have two weeks not two months, plus how does that even help mankind lol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visibly lost, out instructor approached us and said “why not red-build the app that helps students manage class?”. I thought now this is a brilliant idea! The current app provided a less than pleasurable experience because of it’s over complexity and lack of intuitiveness. To make matters worse, it looked unrefined and outdated. A bit harsh but true.
            </p>
            <p>
                We all agreed that this was it and so began our journey down one of the most frustrating and emotionally challenging, yet fun and rewarding experiences that will always be one of our best memories.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The current application was over complicated, lacked intuitiveness and progressive disclosure, and had an outdated visual aesthetic. For example, On my evening rush to class, I would constantly find myself in a predicament trying to login as fast as I could so I wouldn't be marked late for class. I would have to navigate through at least 3 screens before I had the option to perform such a simple task. On top of that, the button I needed to click was small and out of place. Not a huge deal but think about trying to do this in the 10 seconds you have left before class starts while you are rushing lol.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Limit the features to what students actually use, make it easy for them to be able to do what they came to do, incorporate progressive disclosure to limit confusion and promote intuitiveness and last but not least, make it visually appealing, an interface in line with the school’s brand that the user will enjoy interacting with and want to come back to.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Strategy</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                We started out by interviewing students and mapping out their current user journey. This helped us understand pain points, opportunities and what users would likely value most in their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                After understanding the problem, we started really thinking about what we reasonably achieve vs the return value. After all, we only had two weeks and our offering had to make an impact.     </p>
            <p>
                Once we agreed on the requirements and feasibility, we moved onto white-boarding and low fidelity design mockups. Under a “cloak of secrecy”, we tested tested our designs on a group of potential users then iterated on the design until we felt like we were ready to go into production. At least as ready as we could be...version 1 here we come.

                We developed a timetable for each task. We would do a pulse check every three days to see where everyone was in their sprint. Each person had their part to play and each part replied on the other. We inevitably had to scale back on some of the requirements so we would at least have a working product to show. It wasn’t easy deciding what needed to be cut but that’s how it goes and after each mountain seemed to be an even bigger one. I think we all learned that you have to celebrate the small victories. It will keep you going.

            <h2>The Result</h2>
            <p>
                Although we weren’t able to create all the functionality we wanted even after scaling back, we all agreed it was a success. The class loved it. Our app made frequent tasks easier to perform, information flowed more intuitively, it wasn’t too harsh on eyes  and it was more aligned with the UCF branding.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I wish I could say everything went smoothly but…. nope lol. The collaboration aspect of creating project was definitely, at least for me the most rewarding learning experience ever. Apart from the ups and downs of technical difficulties, we had our share of personality clashes. Yes, there was the guy that wanted a map on the screen for no good reason and the guy that wanted to keep adding requirements even though we didn’t even have the basic functionality dialed in yet. I of course was no stranger here. “Nick we 2 days to complete this page layout, not 3 because you “think” you came up with a better layout…. and we don’t have 1 hour to spend on choosing the “right” font” etc  - I still disagree but say what lol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jokes aside, in the end we came out as close friends and still keep in touch to this day. Well except for Mr X….. Although he didn’t contribute to the project (we tried to turn him around, we really did), I convinced everyone that we still needed to include him in the group presentation. We were a team regardless and should ALL share the recognition, no matter how much each person contributed. It might sound cheezy but I genuinely believe in teamwork and comradery. I think we all learned something from each other and about life in general during this project.
